title: About Me
---

Please don't make it wrong. The blue budgie is not me but my favourite pet, and I call it Brutus. It was my only family member till I met my love. Brutus has several abilities, sleep, eat, climb and make noise :) Unfortunately, I am not able to train it to speak but Brutus learnt how to bark :(

I was a motor mechanic and left the position because I suffered back pain for over two years. 
Believe it or not, I learnt western painting for over seven years before 18, and I made some portrait sketch for my colleagues.

- **MY STUDY**  
I am a fresh graduate from Monash University with a degree in Bachelor of
Commerce majoring in Actuarial studies. I am a data-oriented person and have a
genuine interest in data analysis and data science.

- **MY HOBBY**  
I love video games, Lego, puzzle and photography. My favourite video game developer is 
Paradox Development Studio and its game Stellaris. In my free time, my partner and I visited many zoos and sanctuaries to photograph wild lives.
