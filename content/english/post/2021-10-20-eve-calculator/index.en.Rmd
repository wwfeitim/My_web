# Introducing EVE (Electric Vehicle Evalution) Calculator

The last piece of my EVE project is completed. I created a light-weighted web app by Shiny in R. It is a calculator that assists you to decide whether you should buy a pure electric car or a gasoline car.
It demonstrates the future value and expenditures of cars with a short conclusion. You can find more details in this app. Besides, you can also use this calculator to predict future value and estimate expenditures for gasoline cars only.
