<p>After two days of struggle, I finally move my posts to the new website, a website that I own.</p>
<p>There was and will be a lot of effort to put into this long-term project. By connecting GitHub, Rstudio and Netlify, I can easily manage and update my post and properly insert more plots and graphs.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the creator of Blogdown, Yihui Xie, who also wrote the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><strong>book</strong></a> with a comprehensive introduction. I should also thank Alison Hill, who made the excellent <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/#welcome"><strong>tutorial</strong></a> explaining the process in detail, which assisted me solved many troubles.</p>
