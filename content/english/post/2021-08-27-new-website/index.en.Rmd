After two days of struggle, I finally move my posts to the new website, a website that I own.

There was and will be a lot of effort to put into this long-term project. By connecting GitHub, Rstudio and Netlify, I can easily manage and update my post and properly insert more plots and graphs. 

Many thanks to the creator of Blogdown, Yihui Xie, who also wrote the [**book**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with a comprehensive introduction. I should also thank Alison Hill, who made the excellent [**tutorial**](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/#welcome) explaining the process in detail, which assisted me solved many troubles.
