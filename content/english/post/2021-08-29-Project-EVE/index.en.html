<p><strong>A new project Eve here!</strong></p>
<p>Recently, my partner is planning to buy her first car. As a former motor mechanic and a fan of data analysis, I decided to provide the best advice to her :)</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am considering buying my first pure electronic car since my father bought a Volkswagen ID.4X Pikachu version three weeks ago. Sometimes I think my father has a more innovative mindset to embrace the latest technology than me. LOL</p>
<p><img src="images/ID.4X.jpeg" /></p>
<p><strong>ID.4</strong> is an excellent pure electronic car at an affordable price in China. However, I guess Volkswagen won’t bring it to the Australian market this year. I guess the main reason is that China has comprehensive manufacturing chains to produce almost every piece of component and assemble them.</p>
<p>The first step is to collect the data from the internet, which I have done 65% including over 40000 car data in Australia. I will study these data and try to create a model to evaluate the car price assisting my partner’s decision making.
I also shared my scraping coding work on <a href="https://github.com/wwfeitim/Eve">Github</a>, and feel free to read and use it.</p>
<p>Some sample data:</p>
<pre><code>##                                             title     price   odometer  body

<p>The second part is to build a calculator by <code>Shiny</code> and insert it into my blog. This calculator can predict the money saved by the switch from fuel combustion vehicle to pure electronic car in long-term period. Learning <code>Shiny</code> is a critical task in this project. By presenting the model through <code>Siny</code>, everyone can use the tool without knowing to program it.</p>
<p>Hoping I can complete this project by October.</p>
